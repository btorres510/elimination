# elimination
'Elimination' is a dice game where the object is to get the lowest score possible, by rolling the dice and eliminating the numbers either through adding the two integers on the dice or adding them up. If you roll doubles, you must take the sum of the dice. When the dice are rolled and you cannot eliminate any numbers, the game is over. The game is written in java.
